Students should be able to note that these are stone tools, shaped like projectile points (arrowheads is acceptable) in 4 different styles. A notable feature common to all the points is that they are quite small, finely made, and they may know that each one was reproduced hundreds of times in a fairly standardized manner. Students can then list some things archaeologists could say about a burial containing hundreds of finely made artifacts – the individual was likely important, there may be social stratification, craft specialization or workshops could have produced the points, they were particular about raw material selection, burial mounds suggest large group efforts that could require leadership, etc.
