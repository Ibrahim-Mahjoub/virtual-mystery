Even if students aren’t familiar with the major “types” of societies, they should be able to classify Cahokia as relatively complex in terms of socio-political structures (stratification, centralization, etc). Cahokia is often called a chiefdom, although this category is no longer accepted by many archaeologists. In general, the existence of an elite class means occupational specialization, often leaders are both politically and religiously powerful, some form of resource production sustains the population, and there will be noticeable differences in the lives of the various classes. The regional point types should tell them that this site is part (if not central) to a larger interaction sphere; Cahokia was not an isolated settlement, and may not have been occupied by a homogenous population. Both good indicators of a relative complex socio-political system with trade networks, alliances, and early forms of cities.
