Excellent, you are getting a sense of why Cahokia has been designated as a historic site! Now you think that visitors will want to know more about the individual buried lavishly in Mound 72, so you move to the next display case showing a reconstruction of the “Birdman” burial where the points were found. It depicts a man laid out atop a pile of shell beads in the form of a giant falcon, and compares it with this stone tablet that shows a recurring Mississippian motif. What do you think the symbolic or iconographic significance of falcons and the birdman may be, and what can you say about this imagery appearing across a broad region? What could this individual’s association with such symbolism say about who they were in life?
