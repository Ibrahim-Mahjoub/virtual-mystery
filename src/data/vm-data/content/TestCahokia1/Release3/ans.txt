Part of this question can be their own interpretations of birds and birds of prey. Students should be able to link the imagery of the birdman to some larger concept other than simply birds. They may note that shared motifs and evidence of trade can indicate an interaction network that moves ideas AND physical goods. If they look online they will find that avian imagery and warfare are connected in Mississippian cosmology, so this individual could have been a respected warrior. There are also connections between animal-people or transformations and shamanism/ritual in many human societies. If students opt to look it up online you may also get a huge range of other answers from warfare to gambling, longevity, and the health of one’s family (among other things). You might also get some stuff about an association with the upper world along with the sun, moon, and four stars. If you get stuff like that then it’s likely they’ve just ripped something straight from Wikipedia. Those answers are still fine but not ideal. Try to encourage them to problem solve and explain their answers a bit.
